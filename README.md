## Description
The challenge this week is to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. Once you’ve made these changes, you’ll deploy the application to Heroku.
  
## Usage
AS AN avid traveler I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.
  
GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection  
  
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit  
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit  
  
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection  
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
